# Memorizing Vocabulary Using Forgetting Curve

## About

Memorizing words could be exasperating for those who wanted to prepare for tests. But it won't have to be. According to Ebbinghaus's
forgetting curve, we can memorize things better by manipulating the time interval of active recall: the more recently memorized words
should be reviewed more often. This program allows you to save words on a specific date and can presents the ones you need to review
on any date. Combining with web crawling, the definition and the word could be presented with both orders (The Cambridge Dictionary
web crawling part is modified from https://github.com/mimiliaogo/cambridge-dictionary-crawler.git by mimiliaogo). Example sentences 
could also be presented.
